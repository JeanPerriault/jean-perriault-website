# PAGES

This directory contains Application Views and Routes.
The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates application router.

> Note: it can be bypassed by using a specific function to generate its own routes, migth be needed when building internationalized website (See middleware/routes-builder.js and nuxt.config.js)

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).
